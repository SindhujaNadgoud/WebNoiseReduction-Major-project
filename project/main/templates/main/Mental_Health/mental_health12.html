    Parents should pay attention to warning signs that their child may be engaging in bullying behavior, like getting into physical or verbal fights or blaming others for their problems. Bystanders to bullying may also experience mental health effects. The same study showed that students who witness bullying at school experienced increased anxiety and depression regardless of whether they supported the bully or the person being bullied.
